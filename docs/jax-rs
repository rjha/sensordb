client accept-header and mime type
-----------------------------------
If a resource class is capable of producing more that one MIME media type 
then the resource method chosen will correspond to the most acceptable media 
type as declared by the client. 


@Consumes
-----------
we can specify what kind of mime types the server accepts. if the same mime
is not sent by client in accept headers then we return an http 204.
