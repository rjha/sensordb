# problem - rollup - cassandra metric style
One idea is to keep rollup of data into memory and flush it to 
disk when next rollup point has arrived. Problem with keeping things in memory
is that individual web app may have their own JVM and a project may be sending 
data to different web apps and hence different JVM.

One way around is to keep temporary rollup data in a memory store accessible
from all nodes across the network (that is backed to disk) - e.g. redis

finally, we want a scale out architecture.
