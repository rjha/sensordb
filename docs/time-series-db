# storing time-series data
 
A project deploys multiple sensors. Each sensor can send data for a number of variables.
Suppose our android smartphone is acting as the sensor. It can send data for accelerometer
as well as GPS co-rodinates. So one sensor is sending four variables, X1,X2,X3,X4.
A variable is denoted by X(i). A sensor is an instance of a device. A device can send an array 
of variables. [X1 X2 X3....]

Any sensor has a frequency at which it sends data. Like, some sensors will send one data point/day
while some other sensor can be sending data every second. (timeseries database accomodate even the millisecond
precision). Caching or man-in-the-middle should be aware of the required frequency of a sensor so they do not 
buffer the data above this interval.

A device can have certain meta data attached to it that is inherited
by sensors. All sensors in turn can define their own meta data via key-value pairs. E.g. suppose we are deploying
A fluid level sensor to measure diesel level in gensets in buildings. One way to identify the sensors in a certain area code
is to add a tag called zipcode to each sensor. There can be multiple sensors belonging to an area code and we can treat them
as a group via zipcode tag.  


# concept of threshold
Values below and above set threshold should be flagged. Like if we are monitoring T and we want to 
send an SMS when T > 350K then we should be able to set a threshold.MAX for sensor variable T 
	threshold.MAX to warn when variable X is above threshold
	threshold.MIN to warn when variable X is below threshold
	
# meta data about data points
store meta-data about
	start TS of a time-series
	latest data and latest TS of a time-series
	
# flagging inactive sensors
A sensor should send data every delta interval? 
	No. How to detect inactive sensors?
	sensor.last_TS is maintained

# consolidation/Rollup
we need to work with the moving average here.
last 5 min of data - for moving average
5 min/ 1 HR/ 1 DAY 
	rollup sizes should be determined a-priori.

	
# query time-series data

#concept time window : 
	Absolute times 
		start_time
		end_time 

	Relative times
		start_time
		end_time

internally, we store (Date.max - Date.now) as a timestamp. 
That means recent events have a smaller TS and TS keep decreasing as time goes on
(eventually at Date.max - we get zero)


Relative time 
	relative to now
	should support often used units like day,hour, minute
	and we should be able to say, give me last 10 mins. data


#concept data points
sensors can have different frequency of sending data. so we should be able to say,
give me last N data points together with getting data in a time window
(using WMI interface from a windows machine - sending CPU utilization every millisecond)

 

#query:1
get last N data points for variable X from a sensor
#query:2
get data for variable X from a sensor in a given time window.	
question : what if a given time window can contain thousands of data points?
#query:3
get latest value reported from a sensor
#query:4
get X value from all sensors having a particular value of a tag e.g. 
		+ from a specific user in a company
		+ filter by a specific gateway (use tags)
		+ city=chennai etc.
# query:5
get max value for a day
how to do that?
+ Day rollup for a particular sensor

#query:6
fetch data for a time window in custom steps
retrieve last week's data - show every second day
How to do that?	
what does that mean anyway? how can we represent 1 day of data as a single data point?
maybe apply aggregator function min/max/average etc.?
we can only apply aggregator functions if data size is small
How to find data size? (end_time - start_time) / resolution for sensor
        
#query:7
find all sensors with variable X > X0		
	e.g. All machines with HOT CPU

#query:8
group by concepts can only work if the data size is small.
we cannot fetch 86,400 points and slice and dice it in groups

#query:9
fetch data across sensors
	- tag based
	- threshold based 
	- what else?

    - Group by value (done on client)
		for a variable, capture data and make slices between min and max
        can we keep stats for each Variable?
        Answer - No. it would not be feasible to store aggregates because we can query
        any arbitrary time window. we have to compute the aggregate.
        find sensor serial numbers for each slice in given time window

    - variable X : max/min/average across the variable in a given time window
        (we always retrieve data in a particular time window)
        these aggregates have to be computed.
        does not look possible to just store and query such functions.

#question - would you like to see all the sensors at the same time?
does it even makes sense?
