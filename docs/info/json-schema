#why json schema validator?
The rest service consumes JSON. what is coming in as string is deserialized
by Jackson library into objects. However, Jackson does not perform any validation
(@JsonProperty(required=true)) during deserialization.

what happens to the missing properties? simply serialized as null.
we can do the check against null for missing required properties but that means
writing more code.

# How about other libraries, e.g. Moxy?



# Bean validation framework
    - hibernate validator can do bean validation.
    - may be more heavy weight as it supports EL syntax as well.
