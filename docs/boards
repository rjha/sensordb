Configuration:
    Sensors => central server
        GSM
            GSM modem
            Module to form SMS payload
            (Data exchange format?)
        Wi-Fi
            Electric imp.
            How to configure imp card?
        Ethernet
            Ethernet shield

    Central Server => Sensor
        GSM
            SMS to GSM modem number
        Wi-Fi
            Web socket
            BSD socket?
        Ethernet
            ?

    Sensors => Gateway
        Bluetooth
        Radio (XBee)
        Ethernet

    Gateway => sensors
        Bluetooth
        Radio
        Ethernet

    Gateway <=> Central Server
        Ethernet
        Wi-Fi
        GSM

    Android Phone <=> sensors
        Bluetooth
        Let the phone control stuff
        Over wireless
        Range of wireless/ Range of bluetooth

    static IP vs non-static IP
    Do we know the IP from outside?
    How to send commands over the network?
    IoT gateway for that!


+ lwIp (lightweight Ip) library?
+ BeRTOS
+ BSD sockets on Arduino? 
(lightweight libraries)
+ web sockets implementation
+ Arduino Ethernet library?
    http://arduino.cc/en/reference/ethernet
    Either server accepting incoming connections
    or client making outgoing connections

+ MQTT (throw it away?)
+ Arduino - RAM/ROM size?
+ Arduino board <=> two way serial communication is always possible
    Trick is to find someone who can accept commands from outside - e.g. GSM
    like RPi box with a GSM modem that can talk to sensors over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or wires 

+ Embedded systems <=> 2-way communication with network
TI stellaris ethernet controller

+ Contiki-Arduino port may not be a great thing!
+ Contiki - may be useless if you are not doing the boards

+ Questions
    why Arduino boards? what is next cost-wise and spec-wise?
    How much do the RFID tags with 20M range cost?
    How much do the Xbee radios cost?
    Radio Tags - 

+ small footprint TCP/IP libraries
